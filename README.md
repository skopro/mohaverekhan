# Introduction

**Mohaverekhan** is an informal Persian text normalizer and part-of-speech (POS) tagger. I worked on this NLP project as my bachelor's thesis during my final years as a computer engineering undergraduate student at the Amirkabir University of Technology.

In this project, texts are first converted from informal to formal using a text normalizer. Then, a POS tagger tags and specifies the part of speech of each word.

I researched, developed, and analyzed various text normalizers and part-of-speech taggers in this project. For example, one text normalizer I explored uses the sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) deep learning model to convert each sentence of an informal text to its formal counterpart.
